# Customer-Call-Records-  
  
Project Created: 2018   
School: Florida Atlantic University  
Class: Data Structures and Algorithms in C++   
  
Used object-oriented programming in C++ to process data for 33 customers with a schema of 7 data points.  Used an algorithm based on total call time, number of calls and taxes to create an invoice for each customer.	  
  
Input and output of the data was done by accessing a dynamic array of call records using classes and overloaded fucntions.
